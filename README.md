1. AI Virtual Mouse

This project uses computer vision and machine learning to create a virtual mouse that can be controlled using hand gestures. The project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements and translate them into mouse cursor movements. This project has various applications in fields such as gaming, accessibility, and human-computer interaction.

2. Face Detection Project

This project demonstrates a face detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system can detect faces in real-time video streams and draw bounding boxes around the detected faces. This project has applications in surveillance, security, and facial recognition systems.

3. Face Mesh Project

This project uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh model to detect and track facial landmarks in real-time video streams. The project demonstrates the ability to track facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and facial contours. This project has applications in fields such as facial recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality.

4. Hand Tracking Project

This project uses MediaPipe's Hand Tracking model to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time video streams. The project demonstrates the ability to track hand movements and detect hand gestures. This project has applications in fields such as gesture recognition, sign language recognition, and human-computer interaction.

5. Pose Estimation Project

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to estimate human pose in real-time video streams. The project demonstrates the ability to track body keypoints such as joints, limbs, and facial landmarks. This project has applications in fields such as fitness tracking, healthcare, and computer vision.
